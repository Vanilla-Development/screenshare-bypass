## You don't need to install any extra python libraries because here are all the libraries used.
ctypes, os, shutil, subprocess, sys, pathlib, tkinter, random -- these are all native python libraries


# Note
The general purpose cleaner should work for most cheats but I'm mainly including cheats that make extra folders or specific traces that a screenshare tool can catch.

Also please for the love of god, just in general download ccleaner and run the drive wiper on C: Drive so you can delete volume shadow copies
